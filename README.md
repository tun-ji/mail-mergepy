I wrote this to perform a mail merge operation on Excel sheets to email student's grades to them.

If you'd like to try this out, make sure you have your excel data in this format (no headings):


| Column     | Format  |
| ------------ | --------- |
| S/N        | Integer |
| First Name | String  |
| Last Name  | String  |
| Score      | String  |
| Email      | String  |
